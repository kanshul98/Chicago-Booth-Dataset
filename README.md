This file is a part of the application process for Chicago Booth School of Economics. The dataset was provided publically, so I took the liberty to show my application work, including the R analysis and results, as a part of my portfolio. The dataset involves two cohorts of children (differentiated by treatment = 0/1), wherein one group was given scholarship for attending pre-school and other was not. Data for their cognitive scores were assessed at baseline and after cohort was completed in 2 years. We wish to understand if the provision of scholarship had a significant effect on cognitive scores for the treatment group, as compared to baseline group. The following github contains relevant files for the analysis work, including my own files and the files that was provided by the Chicago Booth School of Economics for the applicant to conduct the analysis on.
If they have not revoked their dataset and files by now, you may find them in this github profile: https://github.com/josh-t-dean/DataTask25
